# CaseLinker

**CaseLinker** is a project designed to group and visualize **statistical** and **contextual** information from cases involving online exploitation, CSAM, or other forms of abuse.

**Emphasis**
- Clustering and linking cases based on shared characteristics such as victim context, technologies used, and law enforcement actions
- Visualization of cases, with particular attention to tasteful presentation of case content, and pattern analysis across investigations
- Statistical analysis of cases and broader online exploitation trends over time
