# CaseLinker

**CaseLinker** is a project designed to group and visualize **statistical** and **contextual** information from cases involving online child victimization, CSAM, and child sexual exploitation & abuse (CSEA).


This project was motivated by challenges I encountered with  understanding child exploitation cases, including fragmented data sources [cases are scattered across numerous organizations, states, and agencies], cross-case analysis [identifying patterns, similarities, and connections between cases becomes challenging w/o unified system, even when cases share common characteristics such as perpetrators, technologies, or victim demographics], limitations in trend analysis [analyzing the evolution of child exploitations, the mediums in which it occurs, recurring case topics], and the emotional impact of repeatedly reading and processing highly disturbing case material. 

CaseLinker aims to address these challenges by serving as a tool for case analysis, enabling researchers, law enforcement, and advocacy organizations to better understand the landscape of child exploitation.

**Emphasis**
- Clustering and linking cases based on shared characteristics such as victim context, technologies used, and law enforcement actions
- Visualization of cases, with particular attention to tasteful presentation of case content, and pattern analysis across investigations
- Statistical analysis of cases and broader child exploitation trends over time
